Have a question? Found a bug? Want to suggest a feature? Our preferred way is to use
[Github](https://github.com/COVESA/ramses-sdk/issues) for technical communication.
Please create an issue there, provide us with as much information as you can, and we will contact you back!
We welcome anyone, and we are commited to our open source projects, but we ask for some patience if at times
we may be a bit occupied with building cars! ;)
